# solana-program-stubs

This crate provides **stub implementations** for a Solana program interface.
The logic is split into two sides:

- solana program
- loader

## Features

- loader_stubs: provides stubs at the loader application embedded in [LiteSVM's](https://github.com/LiteSVM/litesvm) coverage functionality.
- sol_app_stubs (default): provides macros for stubs on the Solana program side. For Anchor programs check [solana-coverage](https://github.com/procdump/solana-coverage).
